    "description": "The Open Data Hub leverages a microservices-based architecture to make data processing flexible and scalable. Transformer Blueprints are pre-built, reusable microservices designed to simplify the process of converting raw data into a standardized format. These blueprints offer a \"low-code\" approach, allowing you to configure existing transformers for your specific needs without writing extensive code or managing complex data transformation pipelines."
